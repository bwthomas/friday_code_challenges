Screen Scraping Code Challenge
========================

Your challenge, should you accept it, is to create a script that scrapes a jobs board to find out if they have internship positions open. Naturally, a very abstract, unhelpful code challenge. :)

Here are a couple links:

* [Crowd Compass](http://www.crowdcompass.com/careers/)
* [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/about/jobs)
* [Puppet Labs](https://puppetlabs.com/company/careers/)

_At least 2 of those links are much harder to scrape than the other one._

## Process

### Step 1

* Fork and clone this repo
* Pick ONE job board to scrape
* Create your code with tests
* Send me a pull request

### Step 2

* Create a branch called squishy
* Make your code as small as possible (yay golfing!)
* Push your code and make a second pull request

## Bonus points

* Use a gem or scraping tool that nobody else used
* Create the smallest code in step 2
* Create the audience nominated best code
* Create the audience nominated best tests (or the tests that the most people use)
