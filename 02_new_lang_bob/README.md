## New Language, Same Old Bob

Your challenge today, is to take a new look at Bob. Do something wildly different today. You have 2.25 hours.

Some ideas:

* Use a programming language you've never tried
* Use a testing style you've never tried
* Use tests period :)
* Try to program in French or German
* Do it in JRuby or Rubinius
* Do it with threads (EventMachine or Celluloid?)
* Program with a wiener dog in your lap

## Wrapup

At 11:15, those who participated will congregate and show off.
